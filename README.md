## Fotoblog Fun Factory Archieve
Hi, this is all about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) , a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines!
This is learning by doing: I am using openclassrooms, a leading E-learning Platform!:rocket:

Go to 
[Fotoblog Site Course](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/7107341-intermediate-django/)
```
A photography collective is looking 
for a way to share its work with the world. 

They want to be able to upload their photos online 
and also create blog posts about them. 

They have asked you, a Django developer, 
to build a web application that allows 
them to do just that. 

They need to have two tiers of users 
- subscribers and creators - and ensure that 
only the creators can create content. 

This content then needs to be shared in a social feed, 
with subscribers choosing which creators they want to follow.
```

I versioned every advance I made during the course (v3 here :).

For Version 2 please go to this [fotoblog_v2](https://github.com/giljr/fotoblog/)

Go to tags and download V3 working code package.

BTW, You're more then welcome to visit my Web Pages: 

 [Jungletronics](https://medium.com/jungletronics) (Arduino, RPi, PIC, Eagle, Blender, Unity3D, Pixy, and more) 
 [KidsTronics](https://medium.com/kidstronics) (MIT App Inventor, LEGO, Arduino For Kids, and more)
 
 I believe that the essential lessons can be learned about the systems - about the world - 
from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interenting things.

These are the [Levy, Steven(2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396)'s **Hackers Ethic** principles (that I've valued most):
* *Access to computer* - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always *yield to Hands-on Imperative*!
* *Hackers should be judged by their hacking*, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position;
* You can *create art and beauty* on a computer;
* Computer can *change your life for the better*.

Feel at ease to give some feedback!

Bye!
